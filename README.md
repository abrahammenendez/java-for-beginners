**What is this?**

Some Kafka demos used for Stephane Maarek's course [Apache Kafka Series - Learn Apache Kafka for Beginners v2](https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-kafka/).

**What did I learn?**

- Kafka ecosystem
- Topics, partitions, brokers, replicas, producers, consumers, etc.
- Kafka CLI
- How to code simple Kafka producers and consumers
- Real world case studies and use cases
- Somewhat-advanced topic configurations

**How was the course?**

Stephane continues to be my favorite teacher in Udemy. The world of Kafka is gigantic and this course built a nice foundation for my next steps. If I have to say some negative, it could be a little bit shorter!
